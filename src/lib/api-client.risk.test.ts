/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * MSW's Node server (`msw/node`) intercepts requests at the Node.js
 * `http`/`https` module level. jsdom's `XMLHttpRequest` (this repo's
 * default `testEnvironment`) doesn't expose the Fetch API globals
 * (`Request`/`Response`) that `msw/node` needs, so this one file opts into
 * the plain Node test environment — which also means axios uses its
 * `http` adapter here instead of the `xhr` adapter, a closer match to how
 * requests actually flow through `msw/node` in production Node contexts.
